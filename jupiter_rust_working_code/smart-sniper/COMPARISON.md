# 🔥 Bot Comparison: Simple vs Smart Sniper

## Overview

Running **BOTH** bots simultaneously to compare performance:

### Simple Sniper (Baseline)
- **Strategy**: Buy all launches, 60-second fixed exit
- **Risk Management**: None (YOLO mode)
- **Target**: Learn market dynamics

### Smart Sniper (AI-Enhanced)
- **Strategy**: AI-filtered launches, dynamic exits
- **Risk Management**: Multi-factor scoring (0.6+ threshold)
- **Target**: Better win rate through selectivity

## AI Enhancements

### Token Filtering Logic
1. **Name/Symbol Quality Check**
   - Filters out <3 char names, <2 char symbols
   - Scam keyword detection (scam, rug, honeypot, test, fake)

2. **Natural Language Analysis**
   - Vowel/consonant ratio (detects spam)
   - Mixed case bonus (real branding)
   - Repeated character penalty
   - Symbol/name length ratio validation

3. **Risk Scoring System**
   ```
   1.0 base score
   × 0.7 if all caps name
   × 1.2 if alphanumeric symbol
   × 1.1 if 5-20 char name
   × 1.15 if natural vowel ratio
   × 0.6 if repeated chars (aaa, bbb)
   × 1.2 if mixed case branding
   ```

4. **Dynamic Exit Strategy**
   - High quality (>0.9 risk): Hold 90s
   - Medium quality (>0.7 risk): Hold 60s
   - Low quality (<0.7 risk): Exit 45s

5. **Dynamic Slippage**
   - High quality: 10% slippage
   - Medium quality: 15% slippage
   - Risky plays: 20% slippage

## Key Differences

| Feature | Simple Sniper | Smart Sniper |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| Token Analysis | None | AI-powered scoring |
| Filter Rate | 0% | Variable (quality-based) |
| Exit Strategy | Fixed 60s | Dynamic 45-90s |
| Slippage | Fixed 10% | Dynamic 10-20% |
| Position Sizing | Fixed | Fixed (can enhance) |
| Risk Management | None | Multi-factor scoring |

## Expected Results

### Smart Sniper Should:
- ✅ Filter out obvious rugs/scams
- ✅ Hold winners longer (90s for quality)
- ✅ Exit losers faster (45s for risky)
- ✅ Better capital preservation
- ✅ Higher win rate percentage

### Trade-off:
- ❌ Fewer total trades
- ❌ Might miss occasional moonshots
- ✅ But better overall ROI

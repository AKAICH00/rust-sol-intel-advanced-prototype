```

## Your PumpPortal Wallet

All trades happen through PumpPortal's custodial wallet:
```
https://solscan.io/account/FLkMFK19n7e8j3XA9URCrR2MSg9DkVEky2EsYaqmkbZj
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** PumpPortal handles the wallet - you just pay in SOL!

## How It Works Right Now

1. **🔔 Detects Launch** → Instant notification
2. **⚡ Buys 0.05 SOL** → ~$8 per trade
3. **👀 Monitors 60s** → Checks every 10s
4. **💰 Auto-Exits** → Sells at 60s mark
5. **🔄 Repeats** → Free capital, next launch

## What's Happening Overnight

Your bot will:
- Snipe every pump.fun launch it sees
- Max 3 positions at once
- Hold each for 60 seconds
- Exit and rotate

**Possible Volume:**
- Pump.fun averages 50-100 launches per hour
- Your bot could execute 50-100+ trades overnight
- Goal: LEARN from volume, not profit yet

## Check Bot Tomorrow Morning

```bash
# View what happened
cd "/Users/ogsolas/active-projects/rust sol/jup-rust-sdk/simple-sniper"

# Check if still running
ps aux | grep simple-sniper

# View your wallet transactions
https://solscan.io/account/FLkMFK19n7e8j3XA9URCrR2MSg9DkVEky2EsYaqmkbZj
```

## Bot Settings

Located in: `simple-sniper/.env`

```bash
SNIPE_AMOUNT_SOL=0.05    # $8 per trade
MAX_POSITIONS=3           # 3 at once
```

## Stop Bot (Emergency)

```bash
pkill -9 simple-sniper
```

## What to Watch For

**Good Signs:**
- Multiple trades executing
- Quick fills (under 1s)
- Bot cycling through positions

**Bad Signs:**
- No trades after 10 minutes → Check API key
- Errors about insufficient funds → Need more SOL
- WebSocket disconnects → Will auto-reconnect

## Performance Tips

**For Tomorrow:**
- Check total trades executed
- Calculate win rate
- Analyze which tokens moved
- Identify patterns

**Next Iteration:**
- Add momentum detection
- Implement 2x profit targets
- Track whale wallets
- Add AI decision making

## Capital Management

Your ~$16 USD:
- 3 trades × $5 = $15
- ~$1 for gas fees
- When one exits, capital freed immediately

## Reality Check

**This is volume mode:**
- Most launches are dead/rugs
- You're learning the game
- Speed and data > profits
- Education through real trades

## The Plan

1. ✅ Tonight: Let it run, gather data
2. Tomorrow: Analyze results
3. Add intelligence: Momentum, whales, AI
4. Iterate: Improve based on what worked

**Your bot is LIVE. It's trading. It's learning. Wake up tomorrow and see what happened!**

LFG! 🚀

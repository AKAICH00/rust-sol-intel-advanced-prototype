## Bot Strategy

**Entry:**
- Every new pump.fun launch
- No filters (full degen mode)
- 0.05 SOL per trade

**Exit:**
- 60 second timer
- Sell 100% of tokens
- Rotate to next launch

**Why 60 seconds?**
- Pump.fun launches pump FAST
- If no movement in 60s â†’ dead
- Get out and move to next opportunity

## Expected P&L

**Conservative:**
- 30-50% of trades go up
- Small gains, small losses
- Goal: Learn the game, see volume

**Reality Check:**
- Most launches are rugs
- You're paying for speed and education
- Volume > profits at this stage

## ðŸŽ¯ THE GOAL

**Learn by doing.** You're now live trading real launches. Every trade teaches you something. The bot will execute, you'll see what works, what doesn't, and we'll iterate.

**No tiny amounts. No paper trading. FULL SEND.**

LFG! ðŸš€

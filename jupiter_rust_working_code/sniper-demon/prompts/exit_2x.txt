## Decision Required

You've hit 2x profit. The rule says recover 110% and trail the rest.

BUT - check momentum:
- If momentum_score > 0.7: Consider holding longer or partial exit
- If rug_risk > 0.5: Speed matters - take the 2x NOW
- If volume_velocity is increasing: May go higher
- If holder_health is deteriorating: Exit risk increasing

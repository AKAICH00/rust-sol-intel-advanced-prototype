# CONFLICTING SIGNALS: AI Decision Required

## Position Data
- Token: {mint}
- Entry: {entry_sol} SOL
- Current: {current_sol} SOL
- Profit: {profit_multiple}x
- Time Held: {time_elapsed}s

## Signal Conflict
- Momentum Score: {momentum_score}/1.0
- Rug Risk: {rug_risk}/1.0
- Volume Velocity: {volume_velocity}/1.0
- Price Momentum: {price_momentum}/1.0
- Holder Health: {holder_health}/1.0

## Why This Needs AI

Automated rules would exit now, BUT:
- Example 1: Hit 2x target BUT momentum_score = 0.85 (very high)
- Example 2: Momentum stalled BUT holder_health improving (new buyers entering)
- Example 3: Rug risk moderate BUT volume exploding (could overcome)

This is where human-level judgment matters.

## Analysis Framework

**Weigh these factors:**

1. **Momentum Strength** (weight: 40%)
   - momentum_score > 0.8 = Strong bull signal
   - volume_velocity increasing = Growing interest
   - price_momentum > 0.7 = More buyers than sellers

2. **Risk Factors** (weight: 40%)
   - rug_risk > 0.6 = Serious concern
   - holder_health < 0.5 = Concentrated holdings
   - time_elapsed > 300s = Risk increases with time

3. **Profit Protection** (weight: 20%)
   - profit_multiple > 2.0 = Should secure gains
   - profit_multiple < 1.0 = Time to cut losses?
   - has_recovered_initial = Can afford to hold longer

## Decision Matrix

**High Momentum + Low Risk:**
→ Hold or Trail (let it run)

**High Momentum + High Risk:**
→ Partial exit (secure base, let some ride)

**Low Momentum + Any Risk:**
→ Exit (don't hope for recovery)

**At 2x + High Momentum + Low Risk:**
→ This is the KEY conflict - lean toward holding more

**Provide nuanced decision:**
```json
{
  "action": "ExitPartial",
  "exit_percent": 45.0,
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "reasoning": "At 2.1x with momentum 0.82 (very strong) but rug risk 0.45 (moderate). Exit 45% to secure 110% recovery per Rule #9, hold 55% with tight trailing stop. Momentum justifies holding majority but risk requires partial derisking.",
  "suggested_stop": 7.5
}
```

**Your role: Make the judgment call that automation can't.**

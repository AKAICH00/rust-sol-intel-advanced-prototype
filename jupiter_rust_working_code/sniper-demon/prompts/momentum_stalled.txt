# MOMENTUM STALLED: 60-Second Timeout

## Position Data
- Token: {mint}
- Entry: {entry_sol} SOL
- Current: {current_sol} SOL
- Profit: {profit_multiple}x
- Time Held: {time_elapsed}s

## Rule #7 Trigger
- Momentum Score: {momentum_score}/1.0
- Time Elapsed: {time_elapsed}s

Rule: If momentum_score < 0.3 after 60s â†’ Fast exit

## Assessment

This token has been held for {time_elapsed} seconds with low momentum ({momentum_score}).

Factors:
- If momentum_score < 0.2: Dead token, exit
- If volume_velocity near 0: No interest, exit
- If profit_multiple < 0.8: Cut losses fast
- If holder_health improving: Maybe accumulation phase?

**Provide exit decision:**

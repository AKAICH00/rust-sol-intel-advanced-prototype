## Position Data

- Entry: {entry_sol} SOL
- Current: {current_sol} SOL
- Profit: {profit_multiple}x
- Time Held: {time_elapsed}s

## DANGER SIGNALS
- **RUG RISK: {rug_risk}/1.0** ⚠️
- Momentum Score: {momentum_score}/1.0
- Volume Velocity: {volume_velocity}/1.0
- Holder Health: {holder_health}/1.0

## Sniper Rules Context
- Rule #7: Fast exit on danger signals
- PRIORITY: Speed > Everything when rug_risk > 0.7

## CRITICAL DECISION

Rug detection has flagged this token as HIGH RISK.

**When rug_risk > 0.7: SPEED IS 100% MORE IMPORTANT**

Considerations:
- If rug_risk > 0.8: EXIT NOW, no questions
- If rug_risk 0.6-0.8 AND profit > 1.5x: Consider fast partial exit
- If rug_risk 0.6-0.8 AND profit < 1.0x: Cut losses NOW
- Holder concentration matters more than momentum here

**Provide IMMEDIATE decision:**
```json
{
  "action": "Emergency",
  "exit_percent": 100.0,
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "reasoning": "Rug risk 0.85 - critical threshold. Whale concentration detected. EXIT IMMEDIATELY regardless of profit.",
  "suggested_stop": null
}
```

Remember: **A rug pull takes your position to ZERO. Better to exit early than lose everything.**
